**The Power of Community on Reddit**  
https://redditblog.com/2019/09/20/the-power-of-community-on-reddit/  
The social media landscape is changing. In an era of distrust and perfectly-polished online personas, tools that are supposed to bring us together are often making us feel more isolated and distant from one another. At Reddit however, we’ve noticed something different. From page views to time spent on our site and apps, over the past year we’ve seen significant growth in user engagement and conversations—demonstrating that users are deepening their relationships with each other and with Reddit communities. Our users are finding more reasons to visit Reddit, more reasons to become active members of our communities, and more reasons to share the ideas they glean with others.

**Salsify**  
https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/  
Salsify is a new design for real-time Internet video that jointly controls a video codec and a network transport protocol. Current systems (Skype, Facetime, WebRTC) run these components independently, which produces more glitches and stalls when the network is unpredictable. In testing, Salsify consistently outperformed today’s real-time video systems in both quality and delay.

**Things I Learnt from a Senior Software Engineer**  
https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learnt-from-a-senior-dev.html  
Every day, whenever I came across an interesting situation, I logged it. All thanks to sitting next to a senior software engineer, I could closely observe what they were doing, and how it was different from what I would do. We pair-programmed a lot, which made doing this easier. Further, in my team culture it’s not frowned upon to “snoop behind” people writing code. Whenever I sensed something interesting going on, I’d roll around and watch what was happening. I always had the context, thanks to regular standups. I sat next to a senior software engineer for a year. Here’s what I learnt.

**陆奇：要对长期价值保持信心**

**下一个10年，解决问题靠“大脑”！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxNTAzNzU0Ng==&mid=2654637523&idx=2&sn=c32ced384546876f19e50cd95e771edf  
关于人工智能与人类的关系问题，现在有两个阵营。一方阵营以物理学家霍金、马斯克、孙正义和比尔盖茨为代表，对人工智能是否超越人类保持警惕性。另一方阵营是以计算机领域的很多专家为主，国外的很多实验室主任，还有国内的谭铁牛院土、王飞跃和刘伟老师等，不认同人工智能会全面超越人类。在关于人工智能是否超越人类的争论当中，一种被称之为超级智能的新形式正在悄然兴起。什么意思？就是通过我们对互联网大脑的结构的研究，重新给予了超级智能一个和原来的人工智能领域的超级智能的想法不太一样的定义。那具体是什么，接下来会阐述。

**Software Architecture Guide**  
https://martinfowler.com/architecture/  
When people in the software industry talk about “architecture”, they refer to a hazily defined notion of the most important aspects of the internal design of a software system. A good architecture is important, otherwise it becomes slower and more expensive to add new capabilities in the future. This page outlines my view of software architecture and points you to more material about architecture on this site.

**Better Software Engineering Debates**  
https://www.nemil.com/musings/betterdebates.html  
https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2019/three-kinds-of-good-tech-debt  
When I first became a software engineer, I was surprised by the term “religious war” to refer to the angry technical debates that could be had. I wanted to understand what made certain engineering arguments a “religious war” rather than something more consistent with our engineering roots (namely, empiricism and the scientific method). I also became alarmed at the poor engineering choices made after weak technical debates with strong emotions.

**What Every Developer Should Learn Early On**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/08/07/what-every-developer-should-learn-early-on/  
Languages aren’t necessarily “Good” or “Bad”; Reading Other People’s Code is Hard; You’ll Never Write “Perfect” Code; Working as a Programmer Doesn’t Mean 8 Hours of Programming a Day.

**How to Make Your Open Source Project Successful**  
https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-to-make-your-open-source-project-successful/  
I’ve built an open source library vocajs.com that managed to rise to the top trending repositories on GitHub. Along the way, I learned some important principles of how to make a quality open source project. I want to share these ideas:
- 1. No one cares about your project
- 2. Solve a real problem
- 3. Put an accent on quality
- 4. Excellent README.md and documentation
- 5. Showcase with demos and screenshots
- 6. Try building a community
- 7. Let the world know

**Why is modern web development so complicated? A long yet hasty explanation: Part 1!**  
https://www.vrk.dev/2019/07/11/why-is-modern-web-development-so-complicated-a-long-yet-hasty-explanation-part-1/  
Recently I’ve been needing to explain “modern web development workflows” to folks who only have a cursory of vanilla web development workflows and…… It is a LOT to explain! Even a hasty explanation ends up being pretty long. So in the effort of writing more of my explanations down, here is the beginning of a long yet hasty explanation of the evolution of web development: Part 1: How we got from static websites to babel.

**The future of productivity: People and tools that grow together**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-future-of-productivity-people-and-tools-that-grow-together/  
Understanding how people and their tools can grow together to get things done is the goal of this year’s Microsoft Research Faculty Summit: The future of work and the driving force behind the $1 million Microsoft Productivity Research (MPR) RFP, unveiled at the summit today. With this RFP, we’re excited to partner with the academic community in shaping the future of productivity in four key areas: interaction and sensing; machine learning and machine teaching; attention and engagement; and collaboration and human learning.

**frontend design, react, and a bridge over the great divide**  
http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/  
“Frontend development” is now so loaded that I quipped that as a frontend designer I live on the “front of the frontend”, while there are plenty of other developers living on the “back of the frontend”. I’d like to lean into that distinction because this great divide is played out in a very real way in JavaScript frameworks like React.

**Svelte • Cybernetically enhanced web apps**  
https://svelte.dev/  
Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It's a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

**Riot.js - Simple and elegant component-based UI library**  
https://riot.js.org/  
Riot.js is Web Components for everyone. Think React + Polymer but without the bloat. Its API is heavily inspired by Vue.js but it contains instead just the bare minimum to build a modern frontend project. It’s intuitive to use and it weighs almost nothing. And it works today. No reinventing the wheel, but rather taking the good parts of what’s there and making the simplest tool possible. The Riot.js design was driven by The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters philosophy.

https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/serverless-is-a-doctrine-not-a-technology-4193ccb66cfc  
Serverless is a doctrine. What is doctrine? For our purposes, a doctrine is a set of principles that you have learned from experience, and codified into some written form e.g. a set of best practices… like my best practices blog post…

**How to Be Great? Just Be Good, Repeatably**  
https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/  
Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.

**From design patterns to category theory**  
https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory/  
Design Patterns was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions. What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be intuitive. What's the most intuitive abstractions ever? Mathematics.

**Desktop Neo - Rethinking the desktop interface for productivity**  
https://desktopneo.com/  
The desktop computer hasn’t changed much in the last 30 years. It’s still built on windows, folders and mouse input. But we have changed. We now use smartphones and tablets most of the time, since they are much easier to use. The traditional desktop computer is struggling to adapt the simple interfaces of mobile devices while also keeping its focus on productivity. With people switching to mobile devices for mundane tasks, we have the opportunity to rethink the desktop computer with a focus on getting professional work done.

**Always Own Your Platform**  
http://www.alwaysownyourplatform.com/  
The original dream of the web is dying. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Medium, and YouTube entice us to give them our creative work. They control what gets amplified and what gets monetized. A few conference rooms in Silicon Valley dictate our online culture. It's time to take it back.

**The Open Source Seed Initiative**  
https://osseeds.org/  
Inspired by the free and open source software movement that has provided alternatives to proprietary software, OSSI was created to free the seed – to make sure that the genes in at least some seed can never be locked away from use by intellectual property rights.

无论悲喜，反正每个中国人都为春晚辟出了一块“专属记忆”。而从2015年开始，中国人的春晚记忆里被点上了一颗“红痣”。那就是——总有一家顶尖互联网公司面带羞赧地走上舞台，给十几亿人发红包。2019年，央视春晚红包招标时间很晚，距离除夕只有一个多月的时间。巨头们都觉得凶险异常，百度却高高举手：我来！我来！所有吃瓜群众都侧目，这种“情商低”的状态，还真是百度的风格。。。接下来中哥就告诉你，2019年2月4日除夕晚上，这片土地上究竟发生了什么。

**“数据主义者”们的毒鸡汤**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5MzE0NDMyNw==&mid=2651978277&idx=1&sn=87db254c70f51c9c82383d7ecd2f7e3a  
当我们历数过去十年最激动人心的事件，数据的空前崛起一定要占有一席之地。一夜之间，似乎人人都称呼自己是“数据主义者”，企业纷纷向数字化尤其是其中的数据化快马加鞭地转型。大数据之浪潮风起云涌，AlphaGo的胜利更是在我们每个人的屁股上扎了一针浓浓的鸡血，我们欢呼雀跃，相信数据一定能够带给我们一个非常光明的未来。不过，在走向这个光明的未来之前，我们还得熬过“不那么光明”的现在。不光明，是因为那些自称“数据主义者”的存在，他们所行之事，恰恰与他们所“拥护”的相反。他们的鸡汤越浓，毒性就越大，他们越是激昂高呼，反而越是对数据未来的亵渎。如果他们都算是“数据主义者”，那我们就必须清醒地做一个坚定的“反数据主义者”。无他，只是为了保留一份原初的对数据的敬畏。

**Practical Go: Real world advice for writing maintainable Go programs**  
https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/qcon-china.html  
My goal over the next two sessions is to give you my advice for best practices writing Go code. This is a workshop style presentation, I’m going to dispense with the usual slide deck and we’ll work directly from the document which you can take away with you today. 

**None of my projects want to be SPAs**  
https://whatisjasongoldstein.com/writing/help-none-of-my-projects-want-to-be-spas/  
Back in the early days of SPAs, some people argued that it would be faster to only pass the data you need as JSON than to render whole pages. Nearly a decade later, this is almost never true. I can think of a few things that would benefit from being SPAs. A chat application is a no-brainer. A dashboard of realtime data might not need to be a SPA, but would benefit from a reactive component that updates when the API is polled. Maybe a complicated tool like Trello, a Calendar or a Nonlinear Video Editor could make sense, but even those have distinct screens, so a large reactive component on a particular screen may be a better fit. What’s more interesting is how many apps I’m seeing built as an SPA that really don’t need to be. Why does a website that orders food from restaurants need a Megabyte of javascript? 另附：[You probably don’t need a single-page application](https://journal.plausible.io/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app).

In this class, we’ll help you learn how to make the most of tools that productive programmers use. We’ll show you how to navigate the command line, use a powerful text editor, use version control efficiently, automate mundane tasks, manage packages and software, configure your desktop environment, and more.

**The TypeScript Tax - A Cost vs Benefit Analysis**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b  
As TypeScript stands, I would definitely use it again in small open-source libraries, primarily to make life easier for other TypeScript users. But I will not use the current version of TypeScript in my next large scale application, because the larger the project is, the more the costs of using TypeScript compound.

**The Great Divide**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/  
Two front-end developers are sitting at a bar. They have nothing to talk about.  Let’s say there is a divide happening in front-end development. I feel it, but it's not just in my bones. Based on an awful lot of written developer sentiment, interviews Dave Rupert and I have done on ShopTalk, and in-person discussion, it’s, as they say... a thing. The divide is between people who self-identify as a (or have the job title of) front-end developer, yet have divergent skill sets. 另附：[Designing for the web ought to mean making HTML and CSS](https://m.signalvnoise.com/designing-for-the-web-ought-to-mean-making-html-and-css/).
