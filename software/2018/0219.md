**Lazy deserialization**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/02/lazy-deserialization.html  
Lazy deserialization was recently enabled by default in V8 version 6.4, reducing V8’s memory consumption by over 500 KB per browser tab on average. Read on to find out more!

**Under the hood: How Chrome's ad filtering works**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/how-chromes-ad-filtering-works.html  
While most advertising on the web is respectful of user experience, over the years we've increasingly heard from our users that some advertising can be particularly intrusive. As we announced last June, Chrome will tackle this issue by removing ads from sites that do not follow the Better Ads Standards. We've previously discussed some of the details surrounding how Chrome protects users from intrusive ads, but as we approach the launch date of February 15, we wanted to go under the hood and discuss how this feature works in more detail. 

**AMP stories: Bringing visual storytelling to the open web**  
https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/amp-stories-bringing-visual.html  
The [AMP story](https://ampproject.org/stories) format is a recently launched addition to the AMP Project that provides content publishers with a mobile-focused format for delivering news and information as visually rich, tap-through stories.

**nohoist in Workspaces**  
https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/  
As wonderful as yarn workspaces are, the rest of the community hasn’t yet fully caught up with the monorepo hoisting scheme. The introducing of the nohoist is the attempt to provide an easy-to-use mechanism, natively supported by yarn, for enabling workspaces to work with otherwise incompatible libraries. We hope this feature would ease the pain for monorepo developers and strike a balance between efficiency (hoisting as much as possible) and usability (unblock the libraries who haven’t been adapted for workspaces).

**How production engineers support global events on Facebook**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/166966743929963/how-production-engineers-support-global-events-on-facebook/  
People around the world come to Facebook to celebrate and share experiences during special events, such as the Olympics or New Year's Eve. These types of global occurrences can cause spikes in the load and traffic patterns on Facebook's systems, especially with high-bandwidth content like Facebook Live videos. The Production Engineering team at Facebook carefully plans and builds infrastructure to ensure service uptime and reliability even through such spikes. To illustrate how we handle these kinds of planned special events, let's look at how the Production Engineering team has prepared the live video streaming infrastructure for New Year's Eve.

**Hyperapp for Redux refugees**  
https://medium.com/hyperapp/hyperapp-for-redux-refugees-2507c9dd1ddc  
Hyperapp is a single library performing two functions that work well hand in hand with one another. It provides a concise form of immutable state updates similar to Redux/Elm combined with a balanced subset of the virtual DOM functionality you would find in React and its peers. Hyperapp embraces idiomatic JavaScript customs and norms. It holds firm on the functional programming front when managing your state, but takes a pragmatic approach to allowing for side effects, asynchronous actions, and advanced DOM manipulations (more on those first two later). 

**基于 Node.js 实现压缩和解压缩**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33783583  
zip 和 gzip 是两种我们最常见到的压缩格式，当然，gzip 在 Windows 下很少有人接触。
tar 是一种归档格式，它默认不会压缩，需要结合 gzip 来将最终的 tar 文件以 gzip 格式压缩成为一个 tar.gz 文件，通常我们会缩写为 tgz。本文将分别介绍 gzip，tar，tgz 和 zip 的压缩和解压缩在 Node.js 下如何实现。

**聊聊市面上的「真伪」设计系统**  
http://www.uisdc.com/new-for-designers-february-2018  
原子设计系统（下均称为设计系统）这个词应该已经流行很久了，像蚂蚁金服最近出的 Ant Design 3.0 也说是基于「设计系统」进行构建的。如果你没有了解过原子设计系统，那么我建议先去对原子设计系统做一个初步的了解。虽然设计系统这个概念出现了很久，但是从设计师的角度来看，业界仍然存在大量的「伪」设计系统。为什么这么说？

**聊聊微软刚发布的区块链去中心化身份识别系统DID**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMDU1MTE1OQ==&mid=2653549389&idx=1&sn=158f9feb10d76a2e6ca7e15f8ec8a3e8  
这两天区块链技术圈都在讨论微软发布的去中心化身份识别系统 DID (1)，[微软的 DID Decentralized IDs](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/) 是一线大型互联网公司首次公开拥抱去中心化技术，虽然有传闻说 facebook 也在做区块链方面尝试，但是一直未有正式的消息证实。而微软的 DID 项目已经在内部孵化了 12 个月，它给我们展示了未来利用区块链技术实现 DID 身份验证的一个宏伟蓝图。

**Promises are not neutral enough**  
https://staltz.com/promises-are-not-neutral-enough.html  
Even though they fulfill their purpose, JavaScript Promises are an opinionated primitive that introduce a lot of weirdness. This weirdness ends up spreading to other corners of the JavaScript language and ecosystem. Basically Promises are not neutral enough because they introduce 4 opinions: Eager, not lazy; No cancellation; Never synchronous; then() is a mix of map() and flatMap().

**Choosing a JavaScript build tool: to config or not config**  
https://dev.to/netlify/choosing-a-javascript-build-tool-to-config-or-not-config-2ia8  
This post isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list. Rather, it’s meant to provide suggestions to help you get started in researching how different build tools improve the development workflow. While reading through this comparison on build tools you will gain some knowledge to better equip yourself for comparing how these tools line up with your specific needs.

**Ember 3.0 Released**  
https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/02/14/ember-3-0-released.html  
Ember 3.0 doesn't introduce any new functionality, instead it focuses the framework by removing long-deprecated APIs and support for legacy platforms. This blog post will help you understand what is being removed in 3.0 and what migration strategies are available. 

**Replacing jQuery With Vue.js: No Build Step Necessary**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/jquery-vue-javascript/  
What some people might not know is, you can incorporate Vue into your project the same way that you would incorporate jQuery, no build step necessary. Vue is flexible in the sense that we can use it directly in the HTML.

**Using SSE Instead Of WebSockets For Unidirectional Data Flow Over HTTP/2**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/sse-websockets-data-flow-http2/  
Nowadays, there are a few ways to implement these: Long/short polling (client pull); WebSockets (server push); Server-Sent events (server push). We are going to take an in-depth look at the three alternatives after we have set the requirements for our business case.

**Designing, Implementing, and Using Reactive APIs**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/Designing-Implementing-Using-Reactive-APIs  
In this article, we aim to give you some opinionated suggestions about how you should write reactive code.  These opinions come from years of experience developing a large-scale reactive API, and while they might not all be right for you, we hope they give you some direction as you get started on your reactive journey.

**The Practical Test Pyramid**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html  
The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups. Although the concept of the Test Pyramid has been around for a while, teams still struggle to put it into practice properly. This article revisits the original concept of the Test Pyramid and shows how you can put this into practice. It shows which kinds of tests you should be looking for in the different levels of the pyramid and gives practical examples on how these can be implemented.

**Let’s talk about usernames**  
https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/feb/11/usernames/  
I want to spend a little bit of time talking about a deceptively hard problem django-registration has to deal with: usernames. And while I could write this as one of those “falsehoods programmers believe about X” articles, my personal preference is to actually explain why this is trickier than people think, and offer some advice on how to deal with it, rather than just provide mockery with no useful context.

**INTO THE WEEDS OF CSS LAYOUT**  
https://vimeo.com/254679499  
In this talk we’ll take a serious look at the algorithms your browser is using in order to lay things out using Flexbox and Grid. By understanding how these algorithms work, you’ll be in a better position to make good decisions around layout, and fully take advantage of the possible performance gains of new CSS layout.

**Books I had to read to develop a game engine**  
https://www.haroldserrano.com/blog/books-i-used-to-develop-a-game-engine  
If you have decided to develop your game engine, you may be wondering where to start, what books to start reading, etc. If you are in this situation, I recommend getting a copy of the following books found here. Out of all the books I've read, they are the best of the best, so I strongly recommend them. Now, if you want a comprehensive list, the list below should help you.

**Everything you need to know about CSS Variables**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-css-variables-c74d922ea855
CSS now finally supports variables. While preprocessors support a lot more features, the addition of CSS variables is a good one. These move the web even closer to the future. In this guide, I’ll show you how variables work natively in CSS, and how you can use them to make your life a lot easier.

**Create VR on the Web using Unity3D**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/create-vr-on-the-web-using-unity3d/  
We are happy to announce our latest tool by Mozilla, [Unity WebVR Assets](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/109152). It is free to download and available now on the Unity Asset Store. This tool allows creators to publish and share VR experiences they created in Unity on the open web, with a simple URL or link. These experiences can then be viewed with any WebVR enabled browser such as Firefox (using the Oculus Rift or HTC VIVE) and Microsoft Edge (using a Windows Mixed Reality headset).

**Reach for Markdown, not LaTeX**  
https://blog.jez.io/reach-for-markdown/  
I’ve written in the past (twice) about how to streamline the writing process when using LaTeX. Since then, I’ve found that I enjoy writing even more when I don’t have to reach for LaTeX at all. By reaching first for Markdown, then for LaTeX.

**MongoDB Drops ACID**  
https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/multi-document-transactions-in-mongodb  
MongoDB 4.0 will add support for multi-document transactions, making it the only database to combine the speed, flexibility, and power of the document model with ACID data integrity guarantees. Through snapshot isolation, transactions provide a globally consistent view of data, and enforce all-or-nothing execution to maintain data integrity. Transactions in MongoDB will feel just like transactions developers are familiar with from relational databases. 另附：[

Popular React packages such as Redux still work.

**Stencil: A Compiler for Web Components**  
https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil  
Stencil is a simple compiler for generating Web Components. Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool. Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec. 附：[Creating and Publishing Web Components with Stencil](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/02/creating-and-publishing-web-components-with-stencil.html).

**Slack is the opposite of organizational memory**  
https://abe-winter.github.io/plea%27s/help/2018/02/11/slack.html  
Between 2014 and 2016 my working life went through a lot of changes but the worst one was the normalization of slack. Managers like it because it ‘gets things down on paper’, ‘improves reachability’, ‘gets questions answered quickly’. My argument is that it destroys teams’ ability to think, plan & get complex work out the door. Read on for the full story.

**连线-这两年，动荡的Facebook和受伤的扎克伯格**  
http://36kr.com/p/5119578.html  
杂志2018年3月刊封面报道了Facebook在近两年的动荡，以及扎克伯格在其中的变化。Facebook想要扭转一辆已经全速行驶了14年的汽车的行驶方向。从一开始，扎克伯格的抱负就是在Facebook内部创建另一个互联网，或者另一个世界，让人们尽可能多地使用它。这种商业模式是建立在广告之上的，而广告对于人们的时间来说是贪得无厌的。但现在扎克伯格表示，他希望这些新变化会让人们更少使用Facebook。

假如上帝是以算法来构建这个世界，我们也该找到自己的人生算法。至此，让我们总结一下上述段落的观点，并以此作为后面文字的基石：我们所在的世界，看起来是一个“一切不可改变的”钟表宇宙，其实是一个“一切不可预测”的混沌宇宙；我们努力去控制，无论是控制自己的大脑，还是控制外部事物，经常是徒劳的。结果其实是“涌现”出来的；“自动学习”，是一个智能体自我进化的本质，即“算法”。
