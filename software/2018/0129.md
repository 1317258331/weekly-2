**Chrome welcomes Speedometer 2.0!**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2018/01/speedometer-2.html  
The Blink and V8 teams welcome the recent release of the updated Speedometer 2.0 benchmark. Applying the original concept to a list of contemporary frameworks, transpilers and ES2015 features makes the benchmark a prime candidate for optimizations again. Speedometer 2.0 is a great addition to our real-world performance benchmarking tool belt.

**前端工程师的未来在哪里**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzOTU0NTQ0MA==&mid=2247486819&idx=1&sn=90531d46d3ccfcc9e64d9c59b075cfb6  
前端工程师首先是个程序员，其次也是个软件工程师，他们工作在离用户最近的地方，负责人机交互和用户体验，虽然叫“前端”，但其实他们的工作边界其实已经很宽了。展望未来，我想前端的工作会继续分化，也会继续融合，分工是工业革命以来社会高效协作的主要推动力，以后很长一段时间应该也会维持这种形态，融合的原始推动力也是提高效率。分化和融合是不断的演化和互吸收转化的，不过核心的东西我想还是不会有太大变化。

***React and visual automata-based programming**  
https://medium.com/dailyjs/react-and-visual-automata-based-programming-c1d13e153cde  
This post consists of three parts. In the first one I’m telling about my journey to visual automata-based programming. The second one shows the process of building a GUI using visual automata-based programming. The code is written in JavaScript and React is used to render the view. The last part is a summary of my experience with state machines where I explain how did they change the way I think about state management.

**ECMAScript regular expressions are getting better!**  
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es-regexp-proposals#legacy  
This article highlights what’s happening in the world of JavaScript regular expressions right now. Spoiler: it’s quite a lot — there are more RegExp-related proposals currently advancing through the TC39 standardization process than there have been updates to RegExp in the history of ECMAScript! 附：[阮老师的 ES6 正则教程](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/#docs/regex).

**Android native library merging**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/405334539915815/android-native-library-merging/  
Android developers who use lots of C++ code might be familiar with the native library limit that exists in Android versions prior to 4.3. One solution is to manually combine multiple small libraries into one larger one. However, this usually is not a scalable solution. Combining libraries requires moving source code around and carefully managing compilation settings and dependencies. It can also make code less modular, which can be problematic if your organization is building multiple apps from a shared codebase.

**Cloud: IaaS Vs PaaS Vs SaaS Vs DaaS Vs FaaS Vs DBaaS**  
https://brainhub.eu/blog/cloud-architecture-saas-faas-xaas/  
Maybe you heard something about some of the following: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS, FaaS, DBaaS. If you are not a DevOps engineer, you’ve probably heard about some of these concepts but not all of them. I guess even if you have used some of them, you most likely don’t know everything you should. You may have even used some parts without knowing the name of the applied concept. So let’s take a closer look to gain a better understanding of what they really are.

**A GraphQL Primer: Why We Need A New Kind Of API**

**webpack 4 beta — try it today**  
https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-beta-try-it-today-6b1d27d7d7e2  
Performance will be significantly enhanced in multiple scenarios for webpack 4. Here are just a few of the notable changes we made to accomplish this: By default, when using production mode, we will automatically parallelize and cache the minification work done by UglifyJS. We shipped a new version of our plugin system so that event hooks and handlers are monomorphic. In addition, webpack now has dropped Node v4 support, allowing us to add a considerable amount of newer ES6 syntax and data structures, also optimized by V8. So far we have seen real-life reports of 9h to 12min!

**How to Study: A Brief Guide**  
https://www.cse.buffalo.edu//~rapaport/howtostudy.html  
"Studying" is not the same thing as "doing homework"! Studying may include doing homework, but it is also a lot more, as you will see. I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They worked for me when I was in high school, college, and graduate school. Not only that, but they worked equally well for me in humanities courses (like philosophy and literature) and in science courses (like math and computer science).
