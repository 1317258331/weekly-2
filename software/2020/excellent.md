To be truly humane and helpful, technology needs to see the world the same way people do.

**Retool**  
https://retool.com/  
Retool cuts the time it takes to build internal tools in half so you can focus on what matters. Retool has 4 fundamental pieces to it:  
1) Connect your data sources, like PostgreSQL, Salesforce, Firebase, and 20+ more  
2) Build your queries and logic in SQL or Javascript  
3) Connect your queries and logic to prebuilt components like tables, text inputs, and buttons  
4) Organize and connect your components into an app  

**Old CSS, new CSS**

I first got into web design/development in the late 90s, and only as I type this sentence do I realize how long ago that was. And boy, it was horrendous. I mean, being able to make stuff and put it online where other people could see it was pretty slick, but we did not have very much to work with. I’ve been taking for granted that most folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date. Some time ago I encountered a tweet marvelling at what we had to do without border-radius. I still remember waiting with bated breath for it to be unprefixed! But then, I suspect I also know a number of folks who only tried web design in the old days, and assume nothing about it has changed since. I’m here to tell all of you to get off my lawn. Here’s a history of CSS and web design, as I remember it.

**Things I Believe About Software Engineering**  
https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/engineering-beliefs  
Inspired by [Jan Stette's "Things I Believe" post](https://gist.github.com/stettix/5bb2d99e50fdbbd15dd9622837d14e2b), I decided to write down some of the more contentious beliefs I have about software engineering. I've selected some of my more extreme opinions here, so I expect reasonable people to disagree with me. 

**What is SAP**

ERP is where companies store their core operational data. We’re talking about sales projections, purchase orders, and inventory, as well as the processes that act upon that data (e.g. paying out vendors when a purchase order is issued). In a sense, ERP is the “brain” of a company — it stores all important pieces of data and all of the actions possible in data-driven workflows. But before taking over the modern business world, how did ERP software get started? The story of ERP begins with major automation efforts of the 1960s: while the 1940s and 50s were focused on mechanical automation of blue collar work — think General Motors establishing their automation department in 1947 — the automation of white collar work (often via the computer!) began in the 1960s.

**Today, the Trident Era Ends**  
https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/  
Starting now, Microsoft will roll out their new Chromium-based Edge browser to their millions of Windows 10 users. And this will also mark the end of an era. The era of the Trident-Engine. Coming back to my introductory part on ancient civilizations and their achievements: For me, it feels like Internet Explorer already had many of the things that we came to reinvent later and that we now celebrate as innovations. Although our modern reinventions offer more features combined with better developer experience, I came to wonder why we, as a community, only picked up very few of them. Looking at the above list, I would say that Microsoft was lightyears ahead of everyone else in regards to providing tools and solutions for architecting complex and delightful websites. Some syntax may look unfamiliar to us, but this is just because we are not used to it.

**Good times create weak men**  
https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/  
In [Software Disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) we’ve seen how software has degraded in the past two decades. Recently Jonathan Blow gave a talk where he explained why it might be happening. In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what’s going on down the stack. This is where my contribution begins: I believe I have found some pretty vivid examples of how the ladder of abstractions has started to fall and nobody can do anything about it now because we all are used to work only at the very tip of it.

So I want to call it out: where we are today is bullshit. As engineers, we can, and should, and will do better. We can have better tools, we can build better apps, faster, more predictable, more reliable, using fewer resources (orders of magnitude fewer!). We need to understand deeply what we are doing and why. We need to deliver: reliably, predictably, with topmost quality. We can—and should–take pride in our work. Not just “given what we had…”—no buts!
