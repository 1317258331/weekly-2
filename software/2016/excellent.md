**~2015 in review**  
https://medium.com/@sebmck/2015-in-review-51ac7035e272  
This started off as a generic year in review but as I was writing it became a lot more personal. This is my story of how I dealt with going from high school to moving to another country and working in big tech in a little over a year.

讨论 JS 、Web 开发、前端生态，起因是第2篇文章，观点挺偏激的，引发了激烈的讨论，不过的确指出了 Web 生态圈面临的一些问题。第1篇文章比较中肯，指出了关键点在于：选择和集成成本太高，作者也在试图建立一个知识库来解决技术选型问题，这是他采集信息的一个调研： [Should I Use](https://alterx.typeform.com/to/ASrKf9)。这两个文章还引申出两个有意思的东西：[Magpie Developer](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/)、[The programming language cycle](http://quoderat.megginson.com/2006/03/06/programming-languages-of-distinction/)。
相比之下，最近由 [真阿当-当我说前端基础时，我在说什么](http://weibo.com/p/1001603933000810243086) 引发的国内前端界大讨论就平和多了：
- [知乎-如何评价-当我说前端基础时...](https://www.zhihu.com/question/39659757)
- [Vue.js 作者-谈谈前端新技术](http://weibo.com/p/1001603934708609234550)
- [为这几天前端方向所撕的逼做个大总结](http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309403934449430569795)

前端是一个年轻的生态，我们的路还很长，怀着敬畏和谦逊之心、脚踏实地去解决路上的各种问题才是正道。

**JavaScript web apps considered valuable**
http://molily.de/javascript-web-apps/
Recalling best practices for web applications that make heavy use of client-side JavaScript. The solution for bad JavaScript web apps is not to abandon them altogether, but to make better ones. We need to stop excluding JavaScript apps from “the web as it was intended”. JavaScript apps are “on the web” just like other sites. The potential of the web is enormous and we have just started.

**Front-end Application Libraries and Component Architectures**  
http://developer.telerik.com/featured/front-end-application-frameworks-component-architectures/  
Component architectures are an important part of ever modern front-end framework. In this article, I’m going to dissect Polymer, React, Rio.js, Vue.js, Aurelia and Angular 2 components. The goal is to make the commonalities between each solution obvious. Hopefully, this will convince you that learning one or the other isn’t all that complex, given that everyone has somewhat settled on a component architecture.

**What can we learn from how jQuery symbiotically pushed the Web Platform forward?**  
https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/what-can-we-learn-from-how-jquery-symbiotically-pushed-the-web-platform-forward-ce6b20cd4e98  
One of the great things about jQuery was that it had a simple, powerful idea. It’s entire mindset was “find these items in the DOM, and attach these events to them”. The fluent style of API probably opened peoples minds up in a way that only helped us with promises and rethinking APIs such as XHR vs. fetch. 
All in all jQuery has evolved along with the Web platform, helping improve things beyond itself.

**JavaScript At Scale — Achieving High Velocity**  
https://labs.mlssoccer.com/javascript-at-scale-achieving-high-velocity-160c7d78af03  
Many companies choose JavaScript because it is touted as flexible and fast. While this may be true, that same flexibility and speed can get you in a few traps if you are not thoughtful in how you build your JavaScript ecosystem.

**房间和迷宫：一个地牢生成算法**  
http://indienova.com/indie-game-development/rooms-and-mazes-a-procedural-dungeon-generator/  
几个月之前，我承诺要针对之前的一篇针对我的 Roguelike 游戏的 blog：回合制的游戏主循环（turn-based game loops）。然后我就投入到我自己发行的新书：《游戏编程模式（Game Programming Patterns）》中去，并且把这件事情彻底忘掉了。我把大家扔在一边了～～好，今天我终于有时间再思考一下我的 Roguelike 了，那么，忘掉游戏主循环，让我们来研究一下 Roguelike 游戏最有趣也是最有挑战的部分：生成地牢！

**The Zen of Erlang**  
http://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html  
I assume most people here have never used Erlang, have possibly heard of it, maybe just the name. As such, this presentation will only cover the high level concepts of Erlang, in such a way that it may be useful to you in your work or side projects even if you never touch the language.

**Web Pages Will Soon Load Even Faster in Google Chrome**

http://google-opensource.blogspot.fr/2015/09/introducing-brotli-new-compression.html  
采用一种叫 Brotli https://github.com/google/brotli 的压缩技术来提升资源传输效率，Brotli (shortname "br") is used in WOFF 2.0 web fonts with great success. This is about making it available as an HTTP content-encoding method (e.g. Accept-Encoding: br). Advantages of Brotli over gzip: - significantly better compression density - comparable decompression speed。
