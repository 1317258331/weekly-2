**Hacker's guide to Neural Networks**  
http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/  
Hi there, I'm a CS PhD student at Stanford. I've worked on Deep Learning for a few years as part of my research and among several of my related pet projects is ConvNetJS - a Javascript library for training Neural Networks. Javascript allows one to nicely visualize what's going on and to play around with the various hyperparameter settings, but I still regularly hear from people who ask for a more thorough treatment of the topic. This article (which I plan to slowly expand out to lengths of a few book chapters) is my humble attempt. It's on web instead of PDF because all books should be, and eventually it will hopefully include animations/demos etc.  

**The Data Science Handbook**  
http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/  
In The Data Science Handbook, you will find in-depth interviews with 25 remarkable data scientists.   They hail from a wide selection of backgrounds, disciplines, and industries.   Some of them, like DJ Patil and Hilary Mason, were part of the trailblazing wave of data scientists who catapulted the field into national attention.   Others are at the start of their careers, such as Clare Corthell, who made her own path to data science by creating the Open Source Data Science Masters, a self-guided curriculum built on freely available internet resources.
